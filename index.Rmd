# What is R?

> R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical 
> computing and **graphics**

The functionality of R is provided by

* The original R developers (core functionality)
* Extension packages from
    * institutions
    * individuals
    * currently there are `r nrow(available.packages())` packages available
      on the official CRAN archive

# Leaflet

Allows the creation of interactive maps 

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
widget <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% 
  setView(9.1966859, 45.4768277, zoom = 19) %>% 
  addMarkers(9.1966859, 45.4768277, 
             label = htmltools::HTML("<h3>Visualization Workshop</h3><br/>where we are right now"))

save_widget(
  widget, "leaflet.html", 
  knitrOptions = list(
    out.width = 20, out.height = 20
  ))
```

# Leaflet

## usecases

* population densities
* important companies

## Features

* map data is fetched dynamically
    * updates when user zooms in/out
* includes information from openstreetmap.org
* allows layers
    * markers, tooltips
    * shapes(circles, polygons)

# Leaflet

Usage of cicles to visualize population densities

[fullscreen widget](widgets/leaflet2.html)

```{r, include = FALSE}
cities <- read.csv(textConnection("
City,Lat,Long,Pop

  addCircles(lng = ~Long, lat = ~Lat, weight = 1,
    radius = ~sqrt(Pop) * 30, popup = ~City
  )

  widget, "leaflet2.html",

  ))
```

<iframe src="widgets/leaflet2.html" height = 350 width=700 frameBorder="0"></iframe>

# Leaflet (syntax)

The datasets use longitude and latitude coordinates as well as point labels

```{r}
head(cities, 3)
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("leaflet")
library(leaflet)

widget <- leaflet(cities) %>% addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(lng = ~Long, lat = ~Lat, weight = 1,
    radius = ~sqrt(Pop) * 30, popup = ~City
  )
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(widget, "myWidget.html")
```

# Dygraphs

Create interactive time series

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(dygraphs)
lungDeaths <- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths)
widget <- dygraph(lungDeaths, main = "Deaths from Lung Disease (UK)") %>% dyHighlight()
save_widget(widget, "dygraphs.html", background = "#ffffffab")
```

<iframe src="widgets/dygraphs.html" height = 400 width=700 frameBorder="0"></iframe>

---

background-image: url("bg/stock_new.png")

# Dygraphs

* very fast zooming
* series highlighting
* upper/lower bars for prediction intervals

```{r, include = FALSE}
hw <- HoltWinters(ldeaths)
p <- predict(hw, n.ahead = 36, prediction.interval = TRUE)
all <- cbind(ldeaths, p)

widget <- dygraph(all, "Deaths from Lung Disease (UK)") %>%
  dySeries("ldeaths", label = "Actual") %>%
  dySeries(c("p.lwr", "p.fit", "p.upr"), label = "Predicted") %>% 
  dyHighlight()
save_widget(widget, "dygraphs2.html", background = "#ffffffab")
```

## sunburstR

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(sunburstR)
sequences <- source("coicop/import_coicop.R", local = new.env())$value

widget <- sund2b(sequences, width = 600, height = 400)
save_widget(widget, "sund2b2.html", background = "#ffffff8f")

# sunburstR

Sunburts graphics can be regarded as pie charts for hierarchic datasets

The sunburstR package is built around the JavaScript library d3.js

Syntax

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("sunburstR")
library(sunburtsR)
widget <- sund2b(my_data)
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(widget, file = "widget.html")
```

---

background-image: url("bg/sundown.png")
class: brighttext

# sunburstR (Dataset)

* First column: COICOP group (separator: `-`)
* Second columnn: expeditures in million euro

```{r, include = FALSE}
widget <- DT::datatable(sequences, options = list(pageLength = 5, dom = "tp"), 
                        width = 550, height = 200, rownames = FALSE)
save_widget(widget, "sequences.html", background = "#ffffff8f")
```

<iframe src="widgets/sequences.html" height = 350 width=700 frameBorder="0"></iframe>

# networkD3

can create sankey diagrams ([fullscreen](widgets/sankey.html), [details about the data](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/sankey/))

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(networkD3)
URL <- paste0(
        "https://cdn.rawgit.com/christophergandrud/networkD3/",
        "master/JSONdata/energy.json")
Energy <- jsonlite::fromJSON(URL)
# Plot
widget <- sankeyNetwork(Links = Energy$links, Nodes = Energy$nodes, Source = "source",
             Target = "target", Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
             units = "TWh", fontSize = 12, nodeWidth = 30)
save_widget(widget, "sankey.html")
```

<iframe src="widgets/sankey.html" height = 400 width=700 frameBorder="0"></iframe>

---

background-image: url("bg/web-rain.png")

# networkD3

* This package contains several vizualization tools for network data
* network data is representated as nodes and links

```{r}
head(Energy$nodes$name)
head(Energy$links, 4)
```

---

background-image: url("bg/web-rain.png")

# networkD3

Also includes a force network which shows the nodes in an unstructured manner [fullscreen](widgets/force.html)

```{r, include = FALSE}
widget <- forceNetwork(
  Links = Energy$links, 
  Nodes = cbind(Energy$nodes, group = sample(1:4, nrow(Energy$nodes), TRUE)),
  Source = "source", Target = "target",
  Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
  Group = "group", opacity = 0.8,zoom = TRUE)
save_widget(widget, "force.html")
```

<iframe src="widgets/force.html" height = 400 width=700 frameBorder="0"></iframe>

# Conclusions

* visualization tools in R are becoming more and more interactive
* widgets can be created in the R console
    * No JavaScript/CSS/HTML knowledge required
* widgets can be exported as HTML
    * easy embedding in websites
* reproducibility
    * all packages showcased here can be installed with `install.packages`
    * The presentation is available at http://GregordeCillia.github.io/htmlWidgets/
